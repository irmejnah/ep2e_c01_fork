\subsection{Combat}

\texttt{Interface} works for active participation in combat sometimes. \qEnglish{Interface is also used to attack with non-portable weapon emplacements and the weapon systems of piloted (but not jammed or sleeved) vehicles and spacecraft (Weapon Systems â–¶209).} \citep[p. 50]{ep2e_1.1_2019}


\subsection{Clarifications}

\texttt{Perceive}  for Perceive it is stated "use of your physical senses" (p. 51). If so how does \egr{} check for perception?

\texttt{Resources} states that at level 4, which \egr{} has, it might have its own habitat or shuttle \citep[p. 75]{ep2e_1.1_2019}. Clarify, maybe need to pick a location.


\subsection{Leveling or Adjustments}

\texttt{Medicine} is maybe something we should have in the crew? Healing seems to work well enough, but some investigative stuff might be needed.
