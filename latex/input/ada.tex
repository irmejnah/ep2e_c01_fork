\begin{enumerate}
    \item As \gls{Ada} was designed, and until recently exclusively developed, by \egr{} she should approximate some of their ideals, some missconceptions, maybe an error theory or two she can overcome now that she is self-enhancing (though in cooperation).
    \item Based on Ada Lovelace she obviously needs to be good a mathematician as character generation allows for.
    \item Ada Lovelace was trained primarily in mathematics and music.
    \item \gls{Ada}s favorite book obviously is "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach".
    \item Babbage called Ada Lovelace "Enchantress of Numbers", so \egr{} will refer to her, if not as "Ada", mostly as "EoN" or "Enchantress".
    \item Being developed in part on the basis of a \gls{Muse} (and because \texttt{Medicine: Psychosurgery} still will be her most important recurring game mechanics probably) she should have \texttt{Medicine: Psychosurgery} as her secondary stats focus after the mathematician representation.
    \item Don't see why I would put any Lord Byron into her.
    \item Stephen Wolfram's writing \myurl{https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/12/untangling-the-tale-of-ada-lovelace/} is relevant. \egr{} would be in designing her have more or less that perspective. So the perceptions and ideas modern mathematicians have about Ada Lovelace should indeed be as important as or more than historians'. Hard evidence is sparse anyways.
