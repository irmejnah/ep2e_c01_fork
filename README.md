Eclipse Phase 2nd Edition Campaign 01

# Setup LaTeX Environment

1. TeX Live (https://tug.org/texlive/).
1. Download and setup following the installation.


# Compile to PDF (Windows only)

If not on Windows run the LaTeX commands as in the batch file. If you are on Linux this should be easy for you. If you are on MacOS you should reconsider your previous decisions.

1. Open console or PowerShell.
1. In console `m.bat`, in PowerShell `.\m.bat` (typing `m` and hitting TAB should expand to `.\m.bat`).


# Contributions without LaTeX

Write your text without any other formatting than paragraphs. Anything else should be just asking for more formatting/ integration, like

```latex
% headline "The Big Day"
On the day of our Lord 2525-02-28 the Firewall crew THE CREW...
% maybe link "Firewall" and "THE CREW" with the glossary?
```

where the text will be added, and the comments will be translated into LaTeX and its auxiliary tools as needed.

... and DM it. Or just add something to [The Logbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bt4DGv5Dx-UilDSzQVBT0CZuOWF7NazVS-jlQy1pTF0/edit?usp=share_link), which will be integrated into the LaTeX project.
