# Setup LaTeX Environment

1. TeX Live (https://tug.org/texlive/).
1. Download and setup following the installation.


# Compile to PDF (Windows only)

If not on Windows run the LaTeX commands as in the batch file. If you are on Linux this should be easy for you. If you are on MacOS you should reconsider your previous decisions.

1. Open console or PowerShell.
1. In console `m.bat`, in PowerShell `.\m.bat` (typing `m` and hitting TAB should expand to `.\m.bat`).
