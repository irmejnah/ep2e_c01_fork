# Brainstorming 

## Questions
- Who is building a military installation what for?

## Assumptions
- Kellen tries to make us take a sample. Therefore we don't take a sample or at least if we take one we don't get into direct contact with it.
- There is no air in the cavern and it is large. Therefore we can do quite some destructive testing including Superthermite Charges.
- Shining a Laser at it should tell us if it plays by normal physics or Pandora Gate rules, because spectroscopy.
- If it plays by physics it can be destroyed, and if it does not react violently, given the cavern size, safely.
- If it does not play by physics or reacts by leaving/reaching out from the cavern it is about evacuation (even if it was Pandora Gate like  and stayed clam, would you want to isolate it and bet on nobody looking with a growing military installation on the same asteroid?).
- With the infection stuff evacuation is also not completely safe, Egocasting out anyone might spread the infection just as physical evacuation might (reviewing the "operation", which EGR did record, might allow for putting a risk evaluation to that?).
- The disassembly swarm protecting the artifact  deals 1d6/3s, first to armor, reducing it by the ammount (destroy).


## Course of Action

### Worst Case Containment Plan
- Have Firewall stand by out of sensor range/resolution with a thermonuclear strike package of save to assume total containment proportions.
- Have the strike package at dead man switch setup in case the crew gets compromized (not really possible, but what is a good compromise?).

### Evacuation

### Information Gathering
1. Acquire `Skillware` with `Resources IV` once the week lapses. Acquire `Skillsoft, Know: TITAN Tech` to get +30 on all risk evaluation rolls, and maybe be given some more information, especially in combination with `Common Sense`.
1. Try to get a roll from `Skillsoft, Know: TITAN Tech` with `Common Sense` on the basis of the information provided by Joseph Bves and `EGR_2.71828`'s recording of J.B.'s operation on the boy for risk assessment regarding using
    - live dynamic sensor data directly,
    - live dynamic sensor data indirectly (with transformations, intrusion detection system),
    - discrete recordings chunks of dynamic sensor data
    - static snapshots only
1. Laser spectroscopy for more information.
1. Kinetic probing.

### Destroying the Artifact
- Superthermite Charges.
