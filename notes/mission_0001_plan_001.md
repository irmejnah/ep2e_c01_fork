# Planning

## Situation
- `Eludare` has instructed the crew to investigate and plan independently accordingly, assuming full support by `Firewall`. The priorities are saving life, property to the extend affected in the case does not matter. 
- `EGR_2.71828` has setup a dead man switch recommanding `Eludare` sets into motion nuking the asteroid in case the crew does not update the script within 24h, and its `Backup` would be corrupted. They did not however inform the crew of this in order to minimize the attack vectors available to the artifact.

## Questions
- Who is building a military installation what for?

## Assumptions
- Kellen (infected) tries to make us take a sample. Therefore we don't take a sample or at least if we take one we don't get into direct contact with it.
- There is no air in the cavern and it is large. Therefore we can do quite some destructive testing including Superthermite Charges. The swarm might act pretty much gaseous though (not a problem for the Superthermite Charge experiment).
- Shining a Laser at it should tell us if it plays by normal physics or Pandora Gate rules, because spectroscopy.
- If it plays by physics it can be destroyed, and if it does not react violently, given the cavern size, safely.
- If it does not play by physics or reacts by leaving/reaching out from the cavern it is about evacuation (even if it was Pandora Gate like  and stayed clam, would you want to isolate it and bet on nobody looking with a growing military installation on the same asteroid?).
- With the infection stuff evacuation is also not completely safe, Egocasting out anyone might spread the infection just as physical evacuation might (reviewing the "operation", which EGR did record, might allow for putting a risk evaluation to that?).
- The disassembly swarm protecting the artifact  deals 1d6/3s, first to armor, reducing it by the ammount (destroy).
- There seems to be no great haste currently, as according to `Joseph Bves` the `Confessors` have more or less successfully contained the artifact for a year.


## Actionable Items
Brainstorming elements to be used in working out a complete Course of Action.

### Worst Case Containment Plan
- Have Firewall stand by out of sensor range/resolution with a thermonuclear strike package of save to assume total containment proportions.
- Have the strike package at dead man switch setup in case the crew gets compromized (not really possible, but what is a good compromise?).

### Evacuation

### Information Gathering
1. Acquire `Skillware` with `Resources IV` once the week lapses. Acquire `Skillsoft, Know: TITAN Tech` to get +30 on all risk evaluation rolls, and maybe be given some more information, especially in combination with `Common Sense`.
1. Try to get a roll from `Skillsoft, Know: TITAN Tech` with `Common Sense` on the basis of the information provided by `Joseph Bves` and `EGR_2.71828`'s recording of J.B.'s operation on the boy for risk assessment regarding using
    - live dynamic sensor data directly,
    - live dynamic sensor data indirectly (with transformations, intrusion detection system),
    - discrete recordings chunks of dynamic sensor data
    - static snapshots only
1. Laser spectroscopy for more information.
1. Kinetic probing.

### Uparmoring
- Bots
    - Acquire `Heavy Combat Armor` `Single Use Blueprint`, `Maj/3` (`+16/+14`). `Crack` the `Blueprint` (to use it on several bots as they are destroyed). The `Explorenaut` then has `DUR 35` at `28/24` lasting an average of 54s in the swarm. We could add `Structural Enhancement` (pg. 323), `Maj/3` to add `DUR +10`, but that is probably low on the list (better use the time to print a whole other bot to use up). Additional armor modifications (~ `+6/+6`) are available (pg. 217).
- Suits
    - The armor above can be used on suits, too, so most likely doing most of it `Blueprints` wise.
- Depending on size of operation maybe use the `Habitat` `Microfac` to print the `Large Fabber` and escalate from there (including using a new location as secondary base running all preparations from there, while possible observers can watch some cover operations at the current printing location.)

### Moving the Artifact
- Kinetic probing (Kinetic Weapons fire)
- Missile fire
- Energy Weapons fire

### Destroying the Artifact
- Superthermite Charges.

### Moving the Asteroid
Sith:
> If it can not be moved maybe we move the asteroid from it.


## Course of Action
- Adrian acquires printing slots at one of the `Habitat`'s `Minifac` to have SysRig print `Large Fabber`, `Maj/3` and `Robomule` (?) with `Resources IV`. We move into a part of the tunnels covertly, SysRig moving the `Large Fabber` with the `Robomule` as the rest of the crew keeps possible observers busy around the old printing site, and roaming the places not interfering with SysRig bootstrapping base camp 2. SysRig of course using `Burner MeshID` and general stealth methods.
- Once the `Large Fabber` is in position we relocate to base camp 2, Adrian and EGR faking the crew leaving the asteroid in order to be able to work uninterrupted. Should we need some communication we still have `Mesh`, and we can work with the `Confessors` as proxies if need be.
- Print armor, bots, disinfection solution (think cone weapon), beam weopon, kinetic weapon, explosives.
